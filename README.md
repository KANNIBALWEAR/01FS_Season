### Video FS/REC//01: Trackthreat

Underground garage, dimmed neon lights, low to the ground perspective from Osmo Pocket. There is an object lying down on the floor nearby Osmo, it slowly lowers to reveal a black back Kannibal branding somehow included in it (code?). In the background there is an anyonymous techwear ops invdividual. He is lying on the floor, heavy breathing, he selects something on the phone that is next to him on the pavement. 

Osmo start tracking the techwear hacker. Hacker starts saying oh no no no, sees the package near the 'drone' and starts to move around and snatches the package, drone makes some noises, targeting identity overlays initiate. Hacker shoots something unidentified that disables the drone in a puff of smoke, POV camera footage topples over as if it was an actual droid. Crashes. 

Camera swaps to the top down view, contrasty light. Black plastic wrapped package is slightly open with its lid and something is sticking out. There is an arm of the hacker crawling towards the package slowly. 

View swaps to hacker swiping the package with a device and take out the item inside. It's a Kannibal accessory. Fresh wear upgrade/enhancement. Hacker preps the accessory and put it on. Visuals flicker with the name of the accessory and codename. Kannibal logo appears briefly.

Welcome the First Swipe.
